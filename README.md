### Website: https://machinecraft.space/csy2027/

#### Remote Access
For remote access to the server, use the following:
FTP and SSH URL: `machinecraft.space` User: `csy2027` Password: `csy2027`

#### Software
FTP: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (Use SFTP)

#### Server Access
SSH: Try `ssh csy2027@machinecraft.space` in your command line first, if this doesn't work then install PuTTY. If ssh works, enter the password and say "yes" when the first message pops up.

Once you're in the SSH server, you can use ./phpunit to run phpunit, and cd webroot to access the csy2027 folder on the server if needs be. You should also be able to push the server to GitHub using the built in git commands.

There is no log on limit, so everyone should be able to access everything all at the same time.

#### Issues?
If you have any issues with anything above, let Aidan know on the Discord server.
